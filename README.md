<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Our project, Trashifier, is a simple application that can sort trash using Image Classification. It can classify a trash image into 9 categories, which are: Alumunium, Carton, Glass, Organic Waste, Other Plastics, Paper and Cardboard, Plastic, Textiles and Wood. We are trying to attempt to solve one of Indonesia’s biggest problems, which is sorting wastes. How can we classify and sort wastes efficiently?

A 2019 report from the World Bank estimated that Indonesia generates about 175,000 tonnes of waste everyday. That is equivalent to about 8.9 million tonnes of plastic waste each year. Such a large amount of unsorted waste would require a lot of resources for sorting and segregation before the trash can be reprocessed or recycled.

From this information, a question comes into mind: How can we help Indonesian citizens sort trash easily? Sometimes it’s hard to distinguish what trash belongs to what type. Our project is one way to solve this problem. We can help the Indonesian people to easily classify and sort trash by using Image Classification.

In the future, the Internet of Things concept could be implemented on this project so that something like a garbage bin can automatically classify trash, but for now we’re just trying to develop a mobile application.
